# Prompted Questions

## **Question 1**

 ### In this homework cycle we learned about github and all of the possibilities that it offers. We also downloaded a text editor. I chose to go with the atom editor. We also downloaded the git hub desktop application and linked it to the cloud. We learned how to create repositories and publish them to git hub. We also learned some basic terminal functions as well as how to create a mark down file.

 ## **Question 2**

### To complete this assignment I had to create a new repository and an new mark down file so that I could type my information into a .md file. I have included a list of my steps.

## 1. Create new directory in 120-work named hw-2
## 2. Create new file in atom called readme.md
## 3. Answer the prompted questions by creating a mark down file
## 4. Make sure that you include

## **Question 3**

### I had some troubles understanding the exact instructions giving out on moodle. I handled this by either googling and searching for the answer or by asking a friend, who is a graduate student in the computer science field.

## **Question 4**

### I would like to understand why we are using the terminal app to complete tasks versus doing it "the old fashioned way".
